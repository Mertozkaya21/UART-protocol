# UART Implementation Project

## Overview
This project implements the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) communication protocol in the context of CS 223. UART is a widely used serial communication protocol that allows for bidirectional data transfer between devices. This implementation provides functionality to transmit and receive data serially between a microcontroller and another device, such as a computer.

## Features
- **UART Initialization**: Initialize UART communication on the microcontroller.
- **Transmit Data**: Send data from the microcontroller to another device using UART.
- **Receive Data**: Receive data from another device on the microcontroller using UART.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the microcontroller to the device with which you want to communicate via UART. Ensure proper connections for UART communication (TX, RX, ground, etc.).
2. **Software Setup**: Ensure that you have the necessary development environment set up for the microcontroller (e.g., IDE, compiler).
3. **Include UART Library**: Include the UART library in your project. This may involve adding header files and source files to your project directory.
4. **Initialize UART**: In your project code, initialize UART communication by calling the appropriate initialization function provided by the UART library.
5. **Transmit and Receive Data**: Use the provided functions in the UART library to transmit and receive data as needed in your project.

## Usage
1. Include the necessary UART library header files in your project.
2. Initialize UART communication in your project initialization code.
3. Use the provided functions for transmitting and receiving data in your application code.
5. Compile and upload the project to the microcontroller.
6. Test the UART communication by transmitting and receiving data between the microcontroller and the connected device.
